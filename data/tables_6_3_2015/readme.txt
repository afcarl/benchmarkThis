table_1 :
   Used to generate
      - simple_nonzero_eco_roc_curve.png
      - simple_nonzero_eco_pre_recall_curve.png
   Generated using only commensal relationships with 30 groups of
   2 or 3 interacting species.  Each group has an interaction strength of 1.1x

table_2 :
   Used to generate
      - uniform_rare_eco_roc_curve.png
      - uniform_rare_eco_pre_recall_curve.png
   Generated using only commensal relationships with 30 groups of
   2 or 3 interacting species.  Each group has an interaction strength of 1.1x
   Used the simulated data from table 1 and rarified to 2000 individuals

table_3 :
   Used to generate
      - random_rare_eco_roc_curve.png
      - random_rare_eco_pre_recall_curve.png
   Generated using only commensal relationships with 30 groups of
   2 or 3 interacting species.  Each group has an interaction strength of 1.1x
   Used the simulated data from table 2 and rarified to a geometrically
   distributed sampling depth with a mininum of 2000 species.
   This is supposed to simulate a more realistic scenario of microbial sampling
